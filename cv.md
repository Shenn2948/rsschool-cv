## Summary
 - I graduated from BNTU in 2015 and worked in the architectural and engineering field using BIM technologies. I started learning and programming about 2 years ago, working on scripting and plugins for Autodesk Revit in C #. I spent a lot of time on self-education in programming, and also successfully completed the EPAM laboratory course ``Developing Modern Web Applications with ASP.NET (NET2019Q4N6)``, but unfortunately, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the number of employees in EPAM is limited and I continue my studies. Now I decided to improve my knowledge in the front-end, in javascript and angular, developing as a full-stack.
